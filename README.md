## Hangul Beta
This project was done using [ruby 2D gem](http://www.ruby2d.com/). This game is no longer developped because I'm currently rewriting it in javascript / vue.js.

The purpose of this game is to learn korean alphabet.
 * Guess each korean alphabet letter displayed on screen by typing the equivalent roman letter and press enter </p>
 * If guess is correct : 1 point and the letter explodes.
 * If guess is incorrect : game continue.
 * If letter disappears : you loose</p>

## Installation Hints

The easiest way is to use bundler to install the dependencies. To do so, you need to install the bundler gem if you haven't already done so

    gem install bundler

run bundler

    bundle
